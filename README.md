# ENERGY COSUMPTION OF HOUSEHOLDS APPPLIANCES
First of all to be able to achieve a result for the problem the householders have to be equipped 
with technologies. The devices are provided to inform the consumers about their consumption 
pattern by showing or sending different kinds of consumption information to them. This kind of 
information is provided to assist them in making decisions about altering their consumption 
behavior or to urge them to modify their life style during peak hours. We propose that the 
energy home controllers should offer preferred and optimal scenarios to support end-users 
when making a decision about their consumption. Effective scenarios should emerge from 
consumer’s life style and preferences. In this paper, we will apply AHP methodology to quantify 
the consumer’s preferences for using appliances during peak periods when the price has 
increased, and use the Knapsack problem approach to achieve the optimal solution for 
managing the appliances. With this approach, not only will the cost of electricity not escalate 
during peak hours, but also user preferences, satisfaction and minimum change to current life 
style will be considered. (Omid Ameri Sianaki, Omar Hussain and Azadeh Rajabian Tabesh, 
2010)
By applying an analytic hierarchy process technique, we will build a hierarchy of appliances 
according to consumer’s preferences, and then using the zero-one Knapsacks problem 
algorithm, we will select the appliances with maximum total value; by ‘value’, we mean those 
appliances whose use is of the highest importance according to the end user’s lifestyle and 
preferences.
Dynamic programming is one of the oldest methods in combinatorial optimization. It was used 
very early in particular for knapsack type problems. The knapsack problem derives its name 
from the problem faced by a hitch-hiker who has to fill up his knapsack by selecting from 
various possible items those which will give him greatest satisfaction. (Omid Ameri Sianaki, 
Omar Hussain and Azadeh Rajabian Tabesh, 2010)
APPLICATION
Application has these services:
 Creating user
 Sing in
 Adding appliances 
 Adding time of use
 Adding the priority of appliances
 Adding Price
 Adding High tariffs price
 Results in a list of appliances
Application will take information of appliances from user and using dynamics
programming and Knapsack Problem will return the optimal solution of appliances. Here 
as constrain is the electricity price and the value that we want to maximize is the priority
or the important appliances. Constrain or limit of price is created by adding the 
appliances price in low tariffs. So when there high tariffs the consumer wants to pay same 
price, and that is achieved by selecting from the list of appliances. In conclusion this 
application helps to manage the selection of appliances so the consumer can pay same 
taxes for electricity as it pays in low tariffs.
