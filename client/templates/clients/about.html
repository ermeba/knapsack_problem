                        <h5 class="description">The Knapsack Problem is one of the famous problems in optimization,
                            specifically in finding the optimal solution from various items.
                            The motivation of this problem comes where someone needs to maximize his knapsack capacity
                            with the most valuable items possible. There are many approaches to solve the efficiency consumption for household using knapsack.
                            Three methods have been chosen for this case to check their advantages and to make comparison between them.
                            Knapsack problem has broad applications in different fields such as machine scheduling, space allocation,
                            and asset optimization. Meanwhile, it is a hard problem due to its computational complexity,
                            but numerous solution approaches have been developed for a variety of KP.</h5>

                        <h5 class="description">Knapsack Problem (KP) is one of the most profound problems in computer science.
                            Its applications are very wide in many other disciplines liken business, project management, decision-making, etc.
                            In this paper we are trying to compare between two approaches for solving the KP, these are the Greedy approach and the
                            Dynamic Programming approach. Each approach is explained by an algorithm. Then results are obtained by implementing the algorithm.
                            The results show that DP outperforms Greedy in terms of the optimized solution, while greedy is better than DP with respect to
                            runtime and space requirements.(Namer Ali Al Etawi, , Fatima Thaher Aburomman 2, 2020)
                            Knapsack problems are usually sub-problems of more complex combinatorial optimization problems, and most of them require the selection of a subset
                            of some given items resulting in the maximization of a profit sum, with the total assigned weight not exceeding the capacity of the knapsack(s). All knapsack problems are classified as being NP-hard, meaning that their optimal solutions cannot be obtained by the application of polynomial time algorithms. However, several years of research have 2 exposed the structural properties of these problems making them easier to solve.
